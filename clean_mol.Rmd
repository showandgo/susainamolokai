Pull a database from shapefile, read in a .csv file with description of archeological site (0 = M Major/ 1 = Other sites).
Create a new column in the shapefile database with a <merge>, and then write to a shapefile 

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(sp)
library(rgdal)
```

```{r}
arch_pnt<- readOGR("AddArchSts_Proj.shp")
View(arch_pnt)
```

```{r}
id <- read.csv("for_spjoin.csv")
```

```{r}
arch_pnt_merged <- merge(arch_pnt, id, by.x = "Id", by.y = "ID")
```

```{r}
writeOGR(arch_pnt_merged, dsn = ".", layer = 'poly', driver = "ESRI Shapefile")
```
