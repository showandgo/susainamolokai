## Motivation

There is so much good science and local regenerative efforts in the Moloka'i community. This platform seeks to be a place for all to discover and share all the *mana'o* we have accumulated, and in so doing have a shared understanding of Moloka'i's rich history, culture and biome.

The maps below are split into two categories-
1. Place

<font size="2"> Signifying our sense of place, a connection to our history, which *Ahupuaa* we belong to </font>

3. Biome

<font size="2"> What grows where you are? Where exactly are the boundaries of ecological zones (*wao*) located? </font>
