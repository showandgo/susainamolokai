## Motivation

There is so much good science and local regenerative efforts in the Moloka'i community. This platform seeks to be a place for all to discover and share all the *mana'o* we have accumulated, and in so doing have a shared understanding of Moloka'i's rich history, culture and biome.

The maps below are split into two categories-
1. Place
   
   * Signifying our sense of place, a connection to our history, which *Ahupuaa* we belong to
<br>

2. Biome
   
   * What grows where you are? Where exactly are the boundaries of ecological zones (*wao*) located?
<br>

## Potential Applications

1.  Spatial Planning & Conservation 
    
    * Locating Resilience Center, food hub  
    * Relocating town center/ critical infrastructure
    * Separation of Wao kanaka, Wao la’au, Wao nahele, Wao kele, Wao akua
    * Ahupuaa Management
    * Reintroduction of native agriculture/ species

2.  Educational Tool 
    
    * Ali’i era social ecological zones 

3.  Non-exhaustive! 
    
    * Additional layers- demographic, precipitation, sea level rise, land ownership parcels
    * Let me know what you'd like to see, or if you have a dataset you would like to showcase here!
